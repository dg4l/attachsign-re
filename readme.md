# attachsign-re

A decompilation of Nintendo's tool for signing DS Download Play ROMs. 

## Building

To build on Linux, simply run:

```bash
make
```

Building on Windows is tedious, so I have provided a [prebuilt binary](https://github.com) for Windows users.

## Disclaimers

This decompilation may not be 100% accurate, if you notice any issues, please submit either a pull request or an issue.

If you would like a copy of the original tool, you must **legally obtain** and dump a copy of "The Princess and the Frog"

**Please note that this does not create signatures, it only attaches them to a ROM.**
